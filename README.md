# Learn To Build React

It took me a couple of days to read [Build react from scratch](https://github.com/zpao/building-react-from-scratch) which is mainly what I focused on as well as [Learn-React-Source-Code](https://github.com/cyan33/learn-react-source-code) which has detailed tutorial blogs to explain some main perceptions. These are pretty good materials to understand react source codes, the work flow and perceive the shortcuts. **To make it more understandable, these blogs try to give more add-ons on how react works step by steps.**

## Blogs
* [What happened in App.js]()
* [TBA]()
 
## What I'm Doing
Though with those tutorials, blogs and friendly comments, I still met a lot of trouble with codes and try to understanding what these means. These are source codes afterall ^.^
So here I would like to write some add-ons, mainly focus on showing the work flow and try to explain how react actually works step by step. I would try to explain some complex parts of codes as well as what problems I habe met and how I figured out them. It would be great if these help you better apprehend these codes.

## Run It

Note: it would be a great help to successfully build and run this demo before go into the actual codes. You might wanna use `console.log` to print out the results.

* In dilithium
```sh
> `cd ./dilithium`
> `npm install`
> `npm run build`
```
* In demo
```sh
> `cd ./demo`
> `npm install`
> `npm run build`
```

## Disclaimers
Most of the codes is originally written by [@zpao](https://github.com/zpao) in [Build react from scratch](https://github.com/zpao/building-react-from-scratch). There have been existing summarizable and detailed tutorials - [learn-react-source-code](https://dragonforker.github.io/learn-react-source-code/)
